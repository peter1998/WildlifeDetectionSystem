# Wildlife Detection System - Project Status Report
*April 1, 2025*

## Executive Summary

The Wildlife Detection System is an AI-powered platform for detecting, annotating, and analyzing wildlife in camera trap images. This project is critically important for our state's wildlife conservation efforts, providing essential data for understanding biodiversity, monitoring endangered species, and implementing effective conservation strategies.

Currently, the system has completed its initial development phase with a functional API, database structure, and annotation interfaces. Over 1,800 camera trap images have been indexed, and basic annotation capabilities are operational.

## System Architecture

The project follows a structured architecture:
- Flask backend with RESTful API endpoints
- SQLite database for storing images, species, and annotations
- Web-based annotation interfaces
- Export functionality for ML model training

Key components include:
- Image indexing and management
- Species management
- Bounding box annotation
- Environmental data tracking
- Export to standard ML formats (COCO, YOLO)

## Current Progress

### Completed Features
- Image indexing and management
- Species database and management
- Multiple annotation interfaces (advanced, simple, ground-truth)
- Bounding box creation and manipulation
- "No Animals Present" functionality
- Export to COCO and YOLO formats
- Basic environmental data tracking

### Recent Enhancements
1. **Annotation Interface Improvements**
   - Smart tool for drawing and editing
   - Improved box manipulation
   - Keyboard shortcuts and zoom functionality

2. **Box Coordinate Handling**
   - Fixed issues with coordinate normalization
   - Improved handling of different image sizes

3. **Environmental Tracking**
   - Added endpoints for environmental data
   - Implemented behavioral tracking
   - Added sequence analysis

## Updated Requirements from Prof. Peeva

Based on recent communications with Prof. Peeva, we have clarified the following requirements:

1. **Diurnal Activity Analysis**
   - Focus on seasonal and annual activity patterns (NOT monthly)
   - Categorize by light conditions (darkness, twilight, daylight)
   - Track environmental factors like snow cover

2. **Recognition Challenges**
   - Identification from partial views and distinctive features
   - Particular focus on blurry silhouettes of similar species (wolf/jackal)
   - Adaptation to diverse habitats and lighting conditions

3. **Methodological Clarifications**
   - Focus on existing metadata database
   - For now, exclude specialized data sources mentioned in meetings

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Recognition (Current)
- Identify complete animals in good conditions
- Integrate with existing labeled image database
- Basic differentiation of target species

### Phase 2: Advanced Recognition (May-June 2025)
- Recognize partial silhouettes and characteristic features
- Improve identification of blurry silhouettes of similar species
- Adapt to various imaging conditions
- Integrate environmental factors

### Phase 3: Complex Analysis (Q3-Q4 2025)
- Seasonal and annual activity patterns
- Species interaction tracking and chronological analysis
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Microhabitat analysis including vegetation and environmental conditions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks (April 2025)**
   - Complete annotation of test_01 dataset
   - Improve annotation interface efficiency
   - Begin work on silhouette recognition algorithms

2. **Data Collection**
   - Prof. Peeva will provide primary data after April 13, 2025
   - Allow time for material preparation and review

3. **Technical Development**
   - Train preliminary models with current data
   - Implement seasonal activity analysis components
   - Develop habitat classification features

## Implementation Approach

The development follows an iterative approach:
1. Build and refine the annotation system
2. Create high-quality labeled datasets
3. Train ML models for recognition
4. Expand to environmental and behavioral analysis

This phased approach ensures we deliver increasingly sophisticated capabilities while maintaining a functional system throughout development.

## Significance

This project represents a significant advancement in wildlife monitoring technology for our state. By combining cutting-edge AI with ecological expertise, we are creating a system that will:

1. Enhance conservation management decisions
2. Provide detailed insights into wildlife behavior and habitat usage
3. Support research on endangered and protected species
4. Enable more efficient processing of camera trap data
5. Create valuable datasets for ongoing ecological research
