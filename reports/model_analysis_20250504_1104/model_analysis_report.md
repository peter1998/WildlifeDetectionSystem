## Confidence Threshold Analysis
Threshold | mAP50 | Precision | Recall
----------|-------|-----------|-------
0.25 | 0.5336 | 0.5362 | 0.5032
0.50 | 0.5057 | 0.5316 | 0.4405

## Key Observations

1. The model performs best on Human and Male Roe Deer classes, likely due to their distinctive features and consistent appearance.

2. Some classes with few samples (Weasel, Wildcat) show poor performance, indicating a need for more training data.

3. Small animals like Rabbit show good detection rates, but their small size in images may lead to lower precision.

## Recommendations for Model Improvement

1. **Address Class Imbalance**: 
   - Collect more data for underrepresented classes
   - Use data augmentation techniques for rare species
   - Consider transfer learning from similar species

2. **Environmental Factors**: 
   - Add separate analysis for day/night conditions
   - Consider vegetation density in performance evaluation
   - Analyze distance effects on detection accuracy

3. **Model Architecture Adjustments**:
   - Try different input resolutions for small animals
   - Experiment with different backbone networks
   - Consider specialized models for taxonomic groups

4. **Data Quality Improvements**:
   - Fix corrupt JPEG issues in training data
   - Improve annotation consistency
   - Add metadata about environmental conditions
