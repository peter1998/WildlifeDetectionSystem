|--------|-------|
| epochs | 60 |

## Class Performance

| Class | Precision | Recall | mAP50 |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|

## Observations and Recommendations

### Performance Assessment

- The model shows **poor** overall performance with low mAP50 (<40%).
- The model has a good balance between precision and recall.

### Improvement Opportunities

- Consider collecting more training data for underrepresented species.
- Try different data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Test different backbone architectures (YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m) to find the optimal speed/accuracy tradeoff.
- Evaluate model performance in different lighting conditions and environments.

## Next Steps

1. Review the model performance dashboard for detailed insights.
2. Analyze the confusion matrix to identify commonly confused species.
3. Focus on collecting more data for underrepresented species.
4. Consider a hierarchical detection approach for taxonomic groups.
